    "[00:00.000] Wash the rice taken in a sieve under running water, keep aside.",
    "[00:10.000] Grind ginger, garlic and chilies in a blender to a coarse paste.",
    "[00:20.000] Place a pressure cooker over medium heat, add coconut oil and ghee.",
    "[00:30.000] Add cinnamon and fenugreek seeds to the oil, saute for a second.",
    "[00:40.000] Add onion, curry leaves and ½ tsp salt, saute for a minute.",
    "[00:50.000] Now, add the ground mixture and saute till the raw smell goes away.",
    "[01:00.000] Pour coconut milk and water.",
    "[01:10.000] Add ½ tsp more salt and combine well.",
    "[01:20.000] Let it come to a boil and add the rice to it.",
    "[01:30.000] Cover the pressure cooker and place the whistle on it. Let it cook till 1 to 2 whistles.",
    "[01:35.000] As soon as you get the 1st whistle, remove the cooker from the stove and let the pressure subside.",
    "[01:40.000] Open the lid and combine the rice using a spatula or fork. Serve hot along with chicken/mutton curry or lentil curry, papad and pickle.",
    "[01:45.000] Notes: If you don't have a pressure cooker, you could cook this rice in a saucepan. In pressure cooker the rice will cook very fast, but it will take more time to cook in a saucepan. If cooking in a saucepan, after you cook the rice with coconut milk for 20 minutes or so, check whether the rice has cooked, if the liquid has dried up, add more coconut milk to it and cook accordingly. You can make this with white rice too, but it wouldn't taste that tasty as with red rice."
