      "[00:03:11.000] if we take two ripe plantains it will be",
      "[00:03:13.000] very tough to",
      "[00:03:15.000] stuff the filling uh so here is the",
      "[00:03:17.000] consistency of the plantain so peel off",
      "[00:03:20.000] the skin",

      "[00:03:35.000] plantain",
      "[00:03:38.000] so the cut has to be deep however be",

      "[00:03:46.000] halves so be very gentle",
      "[00:03:49.000] and make the cut and using your fingers",
      "[00:03:53.000] just gently open it up",
      "[00:03:57.000] so we don't have to remove the seeds so",
      "[00:04:00.000] i have made a",
      "[00:04:01.000] nice vertical cut so next",
      "[00:04:04.000] um let's stuff this filling into that",
      "[00:04:07.000] cut or the gap that we have made um",
      "[00:04:11.000] so do not over fill it around",

      "[00:04:35.000] the coconut egg",
      "[00:04:37.000] filling so this looks great",
      "[00:04:40.000] before pan frying the stuffed plantains",
      "[00:04:43.000] we need to",
      "[00:04:44.000] close the cut or the gap so for that",
      "[00:04:46.000] let's make a paste",
      "[00:04:48.000] out of all-purpose flour i've added half",
      "[00:04:51.000] cup",
