    "description": "Crispy dosas stuffed with potatoes & beetroot and the dosa batter fermented in the Instant Pot. Dosa is a crepe made using rice and urad dal or black lentil batter. This is a popular South Indian breakfast dish. If you own an Instant Pot, fermenting dosa batter is a breeze. Ground rice & urad dal batter can be kept in the Instant pot in yogurt setting for 8 to 10 hours. After 10 hours, you will have beautifully fermented dosa batter and you can make crispy dosas. After making dosas, stuff them with potato beetroot masala. Tastes delicious.",
