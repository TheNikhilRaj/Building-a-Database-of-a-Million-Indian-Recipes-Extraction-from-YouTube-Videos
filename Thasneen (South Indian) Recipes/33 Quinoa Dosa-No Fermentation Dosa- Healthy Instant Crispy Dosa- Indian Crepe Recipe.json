      "[00:00:16.000] very popular dish in south india",
      "[00:00:19.000] so for making quinoa dosa instead of",
      "[00:00:21.000] rice i'll be adding quinoa along with",
      "[00:00:24.000] different kinds of lentils so first we",
      "[00:00:26.000] have to soak",
      "[00:00:28.000] everything in water for a few hours and",
      "[00:00:30.000] then make into a",
      "[00:00:31.000] smooth batter and then we can make the",
      "[00:00:33.000] dosa right away we don't have to ferment",
      "[00:00:36.000] the",
      "[00:00:36.000] batter um so this is going to be a very",
      "[00:00:39.000] healthy nutritious and also very",
      "[00:00:41.000] delicious dosa so let's get started and",
      "[00:00:44.000] let's make",
      "[00:00:44.000] kinwa dosa",
      "[00:01:03.000] [Music]",
      "[00:01:10.000] the very first step is to soak",
      "[00:01:12.000] everything in water",
      "[00:01:13.000] so into a large bowl adding one cup",
      "[00:01:15.000] quinoa",
      "[00:01:16.000] i have taken white quinoa half cup oats",
      "[00:01:19.000] so this is",
      "[00:01:19.000] instant oats you can also add rolled",
      "[00:01:22.000] oats",
      "[00:01:23.000] half cup moong dal so this is split",
      "[00:01:26.000] version without the skin",
      "[00:01:28.000] so next i'm going to add half cup red",
      "[00:01:31.000] lentil",
      "[00:01:32.000] half cup urad dal or black gram so this",
      "[00:01:35.000] is also split version without the skin",
      "[00:01:38.000] so finally let's add half cup chana dal",
      "[00:01:45.000] here are the lentils and quinoa for",
      "[00:01:46.000] making the batter",
      "[00:01:48.000] so chana dal urad dal and moong dal",

      "[00:01:53.000] cuisine you will be able to find these",
      "[00:01:56.000] at almost all indian stores",
      "[00:01:59.000] next let's add water around four to five",
      "[00:02:02.000] cups and let everything submerge in",
      "[00:02:04.000] water and let's soak this for four hours",
      "[00:02:10.000] so keep this aside on the counter top",
      "[00:02:13.000] and let it soak for four hours",
      "[00:02:16.000] it's been four hours everything has",
      "[00:02:18.000] soaked well so next i'm going to drain",
      "[00:02:20.000] the water",
      "[00:02:21.000] in a strainer and rinse everything under",
      "[00:02:24.000] running water",
      "[00:02:27.000] let's grind the soaked lentils and",
      "[00:02:29.000] quinoa so i'm going to add these",
      "[00:02:31.000] into a blender jar so let's grind in two",
      "[00:02:34.000] batches",
      "[00:02:36.000] so first i'm going to add half of these",
      "[00:02:38.000] into a blender jar",
      "[00:02:43.000] add enough water to grind into a smooth",
      "[00:02:45.000] batter so i'm going to add around",
      "[00:02:48.000] one and a half cups water",
      "[00:02:52.000] grind to a smooth paste",
      "[00:02:58.000] here is the first batch it has ground",
      "[00:03:00.000] well so pour this",
      "[00:03:01.000] into a large pot so i've taken the",
      "[00:03:04.000] instant pot",
      "[00:03:05.000] ceramic part so this is perfect to store",
      "[00:03:08.000] the batter",
      "[00:03:12.000] next going to grind the remaining",
      "[00:03:13.000] lentils and quinoa so add everything",
      "[00:03:16.000] into the blender jar",
      "[00:03:17.000] and add some water and grind into a",
      "[00:03:19.000] smooth paste",
      "[00:03:23.000] pour the second batch batter into the",
      "[00:03:25.000] pot since we have soaked the lentils and",
      "[00:03:27.000] quinoa for four hours",
      "[00:03:29.000] it didn't take too long to grind",
      "[00:03:31.000] everything into a smooth paste in a few",
      "[00:03:33.000] minutes",
      "[00:03:34.000] everything was ground well so this is",
      "[00:03:36.000] perfect",
      "[00:03:39.000] close the pot with a lid and let's keep",
      "[00:03:41.000] this aside for",
      "[00:03:43.000] 30 minutes now if you don't want to keep",
      "[00:03:45.000] this aside for 30 minutes you can make",
      "[00:03:47.000] the dosas",
      "[00:03:48.000] right away so after 30 minutes here's",
      "[00:03:51.000] how the batter",
      "[00:03:52.000] looks like let's start making the dosas",
      "[00:03:54.000] so i'm going to transfer",
      "[00:03:56.000] some of the batter to a separate bowl so",
      "[00:03:58.000] i won't be making all the dosas right",
      "[00:04:00.000] away",
      "[00:04:02.000] so whatever is required pour that into a",
      "[00:04:05.000] separate bowl",
      "[00:04:09.000] let's add quarter teaspoon salt now if",
      "[00:04:12.000] you want to add some spices you can add",
      "[00:04:14.000] like turmeric powder or cumin powder",
      "[00:04:17.000] or some other kinds of herbs or",
      "[00:04:19.000] seasonings uh you can add to the batter",
      "[00:04:22.000] so give it a good mix i'm using a",
      "[00:04:24.000] non-stick pan",
      "[00:04:26.000] so make sure the pan is not hot so use a",
      "[00:04:29.000] ladle",
      "[00:04:29.000] with round bottom and pour the batter",
      "[00:04:33.000] and gently spread the batter",
      "[00:04:36.000] so if the pan is hot you won't be able",
      "[00:04:39.000] to spread like this",
      "[00:04:40.000] so that's why i have taken the pan out",
      "[00:04:43.000] of the heat and i pour the batter",
      "[00:04:45.000] so this is good next i'm going to",
      "[00:04:47.000] drizzle some ghee or clarified butter",
      "[00:04:51.000] on the batter cook the dosa over",
      "[00:04:55.000] medium heat",
      "[00:04:58.000] let the bottom side cook well so as you",
      "[00:05:01.000] can see",
      "[00:05:01.000] it is starting to turn crispy and golden",
      "[00:05:04.000] brown",
      "[00:05:05.000] so now let's flip this over",
      "[00:05:12.000] using a white spatula flip this over",
      "[00:05:15.000] and let the other side cook as well let",
      "[00:05:18.000] golden brown spots form on the other",
      "[00:05:22.000] side",
      "[00:05:24.000] so i'm going to check this so the other",
      "[00:05:27.000] side",
      "[00:05:28.000] this has cooked perfectly so here's our",
      "[00:05:31.000] quinoa dosa transfer to a plate",
      "[00:05:34.000] looks beautiful",
      "[00:05:38.000] for making the next dosa this is what i",
      "[00:05:40.000] do remove the pan from the heat",
      "[00:05:42.000] let it cool down for a few seconds i'm",
      "[00:05:46.000] also going to",
      "[00:05:47.000] rub a slice of onion on the pan so this",
      "[00:05:50.000] will help the pan to cool down",
      "[00:05:55.000] if the pan is hot we won't be able to",
      "[00:05:57.000] spread the batter",
      "[00:05:58.000] it will start to cook right away so the",
      "[00:06:01.000] pan has cooled down a bit",
      "[00:06:03.000] so i'm going to pour the batter over the",
      "[00:06:07.000] pan",
      "[00:06:13.000] using the bottom of the ladle spread the",
      "[00:06:16.000] batter",
      "[00:06:17.000] so you can also use a cast iron skillet",
      "[00:06:19.000] or a large pan so you can",
      "[00:06:21.000] make large dough sauce so now keep the",
      "[00:06:25.000] pan",
      "[00:06:25.000] over the heat and increase the heat to",
      "[00:06:32.000] medium",
      "[00:06:34.000] drizzle some ghee over the batter so",
      "[00:06:36.000] ghee will make the dosa",
      "[00:06:38.000] taste very delicious so please don't",
      "[00:06:40.000] skip adding ghee",
      "[00:06:42.000] if you don't have ghee you can add",
      "[00:06:44.000] melted butter",
      "[00:06:49.000] any remaining batter you can keep that",
      "[00:06:51.000] in the refrigerator for",
      "[00:06:53.000] three days",
      "[00:07:02.000] here are the beautiful and delicious",
      "[00:07:04.000] quinoa dosa so while serving",
      "[00:07:07.000] you can fold the dosas like this",
      "[00:07:20.000] here's the healthy and nutritious quinoa",
      "[00:07:22.000] dosa and this can be served along with",
      "[00:07:24.000] chutney sambar",
      "[00:07:26.000] or any kinds of vegetable curries and",
      "[00:07:28.000] yes we can make wraps out of it",
      "[00:07:31.000] if you're on a low carb diet and if you",
      "[00:07:33.000] don't want to make dosas with rice you",
