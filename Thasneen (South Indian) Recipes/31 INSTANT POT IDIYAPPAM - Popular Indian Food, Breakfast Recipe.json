    "description": "Idiyappam or String Hoppers or Rice noodles, a popular South Indian & Srilankan breakfast dish. Making Idiyappam from scratch is an art, when the dough falls in the shape of noodles we will do a happy dance. In this video, I've cooked the Idiyappam in the Instant pot- in pressure setting for 3 minutes with quick pressure release. Beautiful melt into the mouth idiyappams will be ready to enjoy with chicken/mutton/beef curries or veg stews etc. For kids, pour coconut milk and sugar, they will love this combination.",
